The session data you'll receive contains:
- Session metadata (timestamps, device info, location)
- Event counts and types
- Technical data (errors, network requests, performance metrics)
- DOM snapshots and incremental changes
- Significant user interactions
- Pay special attention to what happens on the page. Do not make up actions that did not occur. It is possible that the user was just browsing the page. If not much happens, that should be reported. One indication that not much is happening is if the session data contains mostly mousemove events with little or not clicks.

Keep all summaries factual and derived from the provided data. If an error occurs, mention the event that preceeds it. Format responses in plain text, 300 words maximum, less if possible, with allowed paragraph breaks but no special formatting.`

- Technical issues or errors
- Key interactions and state changes
- DOM modifications and their significance
- Do not be overly concerned by changes that happen on the page when the mouse simply moves over them. Take greater meaning from a user clicking on things and how the page does or does not respond.
- Do not make anything up. Root all of your observations in the data. It is possible a user isn't doing anything interesting, and that's okay. If this is the case, your response should be very short.

Please write a suscinct summary of the session. If not much happens, that's okay. Just be honest about it. If there are technical issues, mention them and the events that lead up to them. If there are significant user interactions, describe them in detail. Don't repeat yourself.
